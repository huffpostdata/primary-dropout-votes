Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `node_modules/.bin/coffee index.coffee` to dump a CSV of 2000, 2004 and 2008
primary results.  Run it twice, actually: the first time it'll notify you it's
downloading stuff; the second time it won't, so the output will be a valid CSV.

We scrape the data from [The Green Papers](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/).
